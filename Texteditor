Texteditor

## VI: Can be accessed through bash on Unix machines.

Even though it is everywhere to be found it is very hard to get used to it. Very steep learning curve wwith alot of frustration.




## SublimeText 3: http://www.sublimetext.com/3

Works on every OS and is free to evaluate for ever. The normal price would be 60$.

Has alot of nice features like working on multiple lines simultaneously.


Notepad++: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/

A good Text Editor on a Windows machine.  It looks  abit bloated compared to SublimeText and comes with a bigger installation.
